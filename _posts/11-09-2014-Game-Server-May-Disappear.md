The game server appears to still be running on ``r99acm.device.mst.edu``. If you
would like to continue to develop your AI, you may certainly do so. However,
*the game server will likely be shut off* in the next several hours. Do not be
surprised if your access to the game server suddenly disappears.

If you want to continue developing, don't fret! In the coming weeks, the source
code for MegaMinerAI 14: Plants will be open sourced and available on GitHub.
