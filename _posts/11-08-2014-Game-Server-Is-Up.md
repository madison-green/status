The game server is now operational!

You can connect to it at ``r99acm.device.mst.edu``

As usual, run your AI with the following:

* ``./run r99acm.device.mst.edu`` will create a new game for you.
* ``./run r99acm.device.mst.edu <num>`` will connect you to game
  ``<num>``. If it exists, your game will start. If it doesn't exist,
  then game ``<num>`` will be created for you.
